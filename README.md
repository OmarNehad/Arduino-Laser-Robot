# About the Project

Give context about the project,  it does not have to be as complicated but you may use references on graduation project reports & the goal of the robot.

<aside>
💡 This a report of the elective COME317 Intelligent Robotics course final project at UU. In this project an application using the Arduino microprocessor, solving robots’ kinematics equations and image processing is highlighted.

### The project

The project chosen for this course is an Arduino powered robot with a flexible build that allows it to point a mounted laser at a black dot.

# The robot build

Give info on the parts of the project, how each part will play part in building it and achieving it's goal.

The robot is constructed using a pan-tilt stand (you can insert a picture), we used two servomotors to enable the stand to move horizontally and vertically, the first motor is responsible for the horizontal motion, this motor is attached to the bottom of the stand connecting the whole structure to the base, and the second motor is responsible for the vertical motion, this motor holds the upper and lower part of the robot together resulting in a joint that rotates in the x-y plane. Together with a laser-module we were able to construct the robot, thus finalizing the mechanical work for this project, and what was left to do is the software part.

# Solving kinematics equation

We will do this together 


Forward Kinematics: -

- Draw the Root-to-Hand structure (we can draw it or idk)
- Construct the Variable Table —> Fill it
- Calculate the Root-to-Hand matrix

Inverse Kinematics: -

- find th1 and th2 using the geometric approach (no drawing)

(you can delete this btw i just did this to نرتب افكارنا )
